Big five and cognitive test.
This project is aiming at predicting the Big 5 personality traits and cognitive levels of a individual. Giving advice to individuals and prediction the performance of potential employees for companies
At this point the project uses a self-report test and a cognitive test. The cognitive test is the most psychometrically reliable test known. The big 5 test is a self-report test that is very unreliable.
The aim is to predict the Big 5 using graphology. It is a much more reliable prediction and a faster one.
